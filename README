LoginBackground Readme & License
===============================

Description:
===
This script provides system administrators the ability to deploy your enterprise logo page/policy banner. It can be used only to change the login window background.

This script depends on three other free software:
. SArtFileTools, is developed by Alex Zielenski, you can find it here: https://github.com/alexzielenski/SArtFileTool.
. nConvert, is developed by Pierre-E Gougelet, can be found here: http://www.xnview.com/en/nconvert.html
. ScreenResolution: which is developed by myself, can be found here: https://github.com/Tonyliu2ca/ScreenResolution

System requirement:
===
Mac OS X 10.7.x and 10.8.x

Usage:
===
Make a big png picture file, for now, 2880x1800 pixels is the highest screen resoluntion of any Mac computer can reach. and put your institute comments or banner at the left bottom corner, download all the above three software and put them with the png file into one folder, which is defined by toolPath in postinstall script.

Even Alex claim that his new version of SArtFileTools is compatible with OS X 10.7, but it seems not true upon my test, so find a old version which works for OS X 10.7 SArtfile.bin, it is called SArtFileTool_X7 in my script. Please update me if it's wrong.

It is called postinstall, so you can easily make a install package.
